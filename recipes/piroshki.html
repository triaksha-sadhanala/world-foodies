                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To start to make the dough, combine flour, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl</li>
                            <li>Add in vegetable oil and water, then mix until smooth (If the dough is too dry, add more water; too wet, add more flour.)</li>
                            <li>Cover the dough in a little bit of vegetable oil and place it back in the bowl. Cover
                                the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and put it in a warm place to let the dough rise for
                                about 30-60 minutes.</li>
                            <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Heat olive oil in a pan, skillet, or
                                Dutch oven over medium high heat</li>
                            <li>Add in the meat, garlic, and table salt. Let the meat start to cook and start breaking
                                apart with a wooden spoon until cooked through. Then transfer it into a bowl and add the
                                cooked rice in and mix it up.</li>
                            <li>Once the dough has risen or doubled in size, take it out and put it on a lightly floured
                                surface and knead into a ball, which should take 1-2 minutes. Flatten the ball into a
                                disc and cut it into 12 equal pieces like how you would cut a pizza. Roll each of the
                                pieces into a ball.</li>
                            <li>To start making the pie, take a ball of dough and flatten it in your hands, then put the filling in the center and fold the dough in half over it. Pinch the edges of the dough together to create a sort of half-moon shape. Then, gently flatten it, making sure the sealed crimps are on the flat side.</li>
                            <li>Once the pies are formed, heat 1 inch of oil in a pan or skillet.</li>
                            <li>To cook, simply drop them in the oil when ready and cook until they are golden brown, which usually takes 3-4 minutes. Then, flip and do the same thing. When done, put in a bowl with paper towels to remove the excess oil. Then, proceed to continue with the remaining ones.</li>
                            <li>Serve at warm or room temperature.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>If you're full and still have space in the fridge, cover them in a plastic container and store them with a plastic cover, then reheat them in the oven or the microwave. Piroshki can stay in the fridge for 5 to 6 days.</li>
