                    <p class="recipe_description">A savory mix of fluffy, slightly crispy rice with a
                        distinct chicken flavor, enhanced by the addition of eggs, vegetables like carrots and peas, and
                        a blend of Asian seasonings like soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and sometimes a hint of sesame oil:
                        this, my friend, is the perfect chicken fried rice, or you could say, the World Foodie chicken
                        fried rice.</p>

                            <li>In a skillet or wok, heat up 1 ½ tsp of vegetable oil and another 1 ½ tsp of sesame oil

                            <li>Add in your diced chicken pieces, and season them a little bit with salt and pepper, and
                                cook it for about 5-6 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Set aside your chicken and get ready to move on.</li>
                            <li>Make sure your skillet or wok is at medium high heat again, and add another 1 ½ tsp
                                sesame oil and 1 ½ tsp vegetable oil.</li>
                            <li>Add in your carrots and peas, and start to saute for about a minute. Then, add in your
                                garlic, and saute for another minute(fresh vegetables take a minute longer).

                            <li>Start to push your veggies to the end of the pan.</li>
                            <li>Once all veggies are lining the outside of your pan add the eggs in the middle and
                                scramble them until set.</li>
                            <li>Add chicken back in with your rice as well, and then add in soy sauce to taste, then
                                season with salt and pepper.</li>
                            <li>Toss everything together and enjoy it hot or warm.</li>
