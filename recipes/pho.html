                    <div class="recipe_section instructions">
                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cook the mirepoix. Add your olive oil and shallots to a medium stockpot over medium
                                heat.
                                Cook your shallots for around 5 minutes, making sure to stir often. Add the white parts
                                of
                                the onion, minced garlic, and ginger. Stir well, combine, and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Add your pre-made broth/stock. Your store brought broth/stock to a pot and simmer. Then
                                add your flavors. You can add 1-2 whole star anise, soy sauce, and or fish sauce to the
                                broth. Cover it and leave it to simmer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>How to assemble the bowl:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Slice your meat. It is best if it is thinly sliced. If you going through trouble slicing
                                the
                                meat, you could put it in the freezer for around 10 minutes. This should give you an
                                easier
                                time.</li>
                            <li>Noodles first. Use a large bowl, then divide between as many bowls as desired.</li>
                            <li>Add the raw meat. Yes, RAW. Directly add the meat on top of the rice noodles. Assuming
                                your broth is boiling, and not just luke-warm, the meat should be fully cooked.</li>
                            <li>Add the broth. Make sure it's extremely hot and ladle some directly on the meat.</li>
                            <li>Garnish! Add some extra beef from the bones, or add a sauce… or multiple sauces. It's
                                your time to play around with the flavors and find the perfect one. Enjoy!</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Add lime juice if you'd like your pho to be sourer, or Sriracha, hoisin sauce, or fresh
                                chili if you're going for something spicier.</li>
                            <li>Higher quality serves for better pho, so try to get the best ingredient quality possible
